    Mirrors OpenPI's DeltaActions transform. Applied during preprocessing so the model
    trains on relative offsets instead of absolute positions.
    Caches the last seen state so a paired AbsoluteActionsProcessorStep can reverse
    the conversion during postprocessing.

    Attributes:
        enabled: Whether to apply the relative conversion.
        exclude_joints: Joint names to keep absolute (not converted to relative).
        action_names: Action dimension names from dataset metadata, used to build
            the mask from exclude_joints. If None, all dims are converted.

    Two cached states:
        _last_state:
            Always updated from each observation that flows through the
            preprocessor. Used at training time (where preprocessor runs
            once per (obs, action) pair).

            Snapshot of ``_last_state`` taken at the moment a chunk-based

            so every action in the chunk must be reconstructed by adding
            THAT same state - not the per-frame current state. Without

            current state to each cached chunk action and the arms would
            cumulatively drift in whatever direction the chunk deltas
            point. ``predict_action`` is responsible for calling
            :meth:`latch_chunk_anchor` right before inference; the

            ``_chunk_anchor_state`` over ``_last_state`` when present.
